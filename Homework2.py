# For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more, so 15 rounds up to 20.
# Alternately, round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10. Given 3 ints, a b c, return the sum of their rounded values.
# To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper "def round10(num):" and call it 3 times. Write the helper entirely below and at the same indent level as round_sum().
# round_sum(16, 17, 18) → 60
# round_sum(12, 13, 14) → 30
# round_sum(6, 4, 4) → 10


def round_sum(x, y, j):
    round(x + y + j)
    print(round(x + y + j))


round_sum(23.6, 45.7, 25.7)


def round_10(x):  # x >, < or = 5 = 90

    str(x)
    return x


def round_15(y):
    str(y)
    return y


def round_20(j):

    str(j)

    return j
